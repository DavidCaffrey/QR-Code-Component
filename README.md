## My process
Working from the images and design spec/doc.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid




### What I learned
I approached this project from a desktop first approach and this was a mistake that I will not commit again as I felt it made the task more difficult.Also given that this was a 
simple card Element a mobile first is the best approach.


### Continued development
As this was my first coding challenge from frontendmentor, I have not submitted it to them. For future challenges I intend to use their pro fitures in order to avail of more detailed 
design info and to also submit the challenges.
